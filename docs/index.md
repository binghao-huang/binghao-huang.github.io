I am a second-year Master student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at University of California, San Diego (CA, US) advised by Professor Xiaolong Wang. 
My interested research areas include Robotics, Dexterous manipulation, Reinforcement Learning, Control, Motion Planning, Building robotic simulation environment.


### RESEARCH & WORKING EXPERIENCES 

Research Assistant, Xiaolong Wang’s Group, UC San Diego                             Sep2021- now 

•	Manipulation of a Robot arm with Dexterous Hand based on ROS, building the arm-hand system with hardware design, control, and trajectory optimization. 

•	Dexterous manipulation policy via RL with Point Cloud input: (1) the first policy learning-based framework that achieves such generalization results with dexterous hands. (2) Applied RL algorism in the real robot system to overcome Sim2Real gap. 

•	Continuous human-like robot grasping motion for Dexterous manipulation: (1) Perform sampling with Continuous Grasping Function(CGF) to generate different grasping plans in the simulator. (2) Transfer the sampling of grasping to the real robot. 

•	Working on tactile sensor ‘digit’ to reduce the Sim2Real gap in Dexterous manipulation

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/binghaohuang1/binghaohuang1.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
